# Legacy GitBook summary

This file is preserved for historical reference only.

The site navigation is now driven by `mkdocs.yml`, which mirrors the full content tree under `docs/`.

If you need to add new pages:

1. Create the Markdown file under `docs/` (mirroring the existing folder structure).
2. Update the `nav` section in `mkdocs.yml` so MkDocs exposes the page in the sidebar.
