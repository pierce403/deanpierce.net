# Zero Knowledge VM Hijinks

This is a line of research and a series of talks designed to bring awareness of the power of various Zero Knowledge technologies to different communities. It was first given at ETH Portland where the main focus was an asymmetric unlock of compute that could enabling scaling all the way up to the originally envisioned Etheruem "World Computer". At BSides Portland, the focus was more on privacy and identity tech, with some mention of Zero Knowledge Proof of Exploit, and at Hushcon Seattle the focus was mapping all this out into automated bug markets and self healing software supply chains. Also some discussion around the inevitability of ZK Ransomware scenarios.
