# Rolodex

This talk was given at Toorcamp in 2022. It covered a full attack flow and end to end methodology, from recon to dumping the domain controller, for identity oriented hacking. This was the culmination of the two years I spent doing third party penetration testing and red team engagements, and was delivered right before jumping back into the web3 space.
