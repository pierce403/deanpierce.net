# Planting the Seed

At BSides Portland 2024 I announced the concept for the Portland Hacker Foundation.

## Highlights

- Explored the broken incentive structures in security: companies prioritize compliance over user safety, and resource allocation for fixing vulnerabilities is challenging
- Discussed building communities (#503HAX) and systems (Hashbounty, Cheapbugs.net) to address these challenges
- Introduced alternative funding models: Gitcoin's quadratic funding and Optimism's Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)
- Announced the launch of PDXHF.org under fiscal sponsorship of PDX Hackerspace (CTRL-H)
- Presented the "infinite money glitch" funding model: invest treasury in low-risk securities (~5-10% yearly returns) combined with 501(c)(3) tax deductions to create perpetual funding
- Launched with $60k seed funding, targeting at least 3 microgrants of $1k annually (with three-month delivery timelines)
- Opened grant applications and Signal group for community involvement
- Announced first HACKLUNCH event for November 6th, 2024
