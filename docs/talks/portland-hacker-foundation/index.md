# Portland Hacker Foundation

The Portland Hacker Foundation (PDXHF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering the hacker community in Portland, Oregon. The foundation collects tax-deductible donations and distributes them as grants to people or groups building impactful projects, with a strong emphasis on information security and related fields that embody the hacker ethos.

## Mission

PDXHF focuses on providing microgrants, typically in the range of $1000, for initiatives where a modest investment can lead to significant advancements. This is what we call "Asymmetric Impact" â€“ funding hackers, builders, and educators focused on defensive and offensive security technologies.

## Community

PDXHF thrives within Portland's vibrant hacker scene, centered around PDX Hackerspace (CTRL-H) at 7608 N Interstate Ave. The foundation hosts monthly HACKLUNCH gatherings at the hackerspace on the second Wednesday of each month at noon, providing a space for members to connect, share ideas, and collaborate on projects.
