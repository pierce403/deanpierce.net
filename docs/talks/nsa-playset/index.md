# NSA Playset

A collaborative project aimed at replicating and demystifying surveillance tools detailed in the NSA's ANT catalog leak. By leveraging open-source hardware and software, the NSA Playset demonstrates that advanced surveillance capabilities are not beyond the reach of dedicated researchers and can be recreated on a budget.

## Project Overview

The NSA Playset began as a response to the leaked pages from the NSA's ANT catalog, which revealed sophisticated surveillance gadgets used by intelligence agencies. The project's mission is to:

- Replicate NSA surveillance tools using low-cost, accessible components
- Educate the public and security professionals about potential vulnerabilities
- Demystify the NSA's methods and promote transparency in cybersecurity
- Develop effective countermeasures and improve security practices

## Notable Achievements

The project successfully recreated several tools from the ANT catalog at a fraction of the original cost:

- **TWILIGHTVEGETABLE**: A GSM handset sniffer built for $50 (NSA version: $15,000)
- **SLOTSCREAMER**: A PCIe attack platform using a $100 USB3380-AB evaluation board capable of reading memory and bypassing security measures
- Various devices targeting USB, PCI Express, I2C, GSM, Bluetooth, and RF retroreflectors

## Presentations

The NSA Playset has been featured at major security conferences including ToorCamp, DEFCON, Black Hat, and Ruxcon. Use the navigation links to explore the individual talks and demonstrations.
