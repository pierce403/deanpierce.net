# CheapBugs

Active period : 2016-2018

This project was inspired by high end exploit feeds offered by groups like Exodus and IMMUNITY, but with a goal of empowering the masses rather than only those who could spend 10s to 100s of thousands of dollars on bugs. It also was modeled largely on the various bug bounty platforms that were growing in that era. In another sense, it was basically a version of the full-disclosure mailing list that charged $10 a month for membership, and gave out small prizes every month for the most interesting contributions. Good times.
