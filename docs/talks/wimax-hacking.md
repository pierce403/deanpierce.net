# WiMAX Hacking

Delivered at DEF CON 17 in 2009 and an update in 2010 (DC18)

A version of this talk was also given at the Intel Security Conference in 2010

WiMAX was new, WiMAX had bugs. The talk focused on various ways that the protocol and botched implementations would allow for free high-speed internet, as well as privacy concerns due to weak encryption and authentication mechanisms in early WiMAX deployments.
