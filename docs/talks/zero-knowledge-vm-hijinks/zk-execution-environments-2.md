# Fun with Zero Knowledge Execution Environments (Part 2)

Presented at BSides Portland 2023, this iteration focused more on security and privacy applications, particularly Proof of Exploitability for the infosec community.

## Highlights

- Reframed Zero Knowledge Execution Environments as a new way to think about emerging ZK technologies with implications for privacy, scalability, and verifiable computing
- Walked through ZK history: from the interactive "Cave of Ali Baba" protocol (1990) through ZK Gadgets and Circuits (CIRCOM), to ZK Virtual Machines like Polygon ZkEVM
- Deep dive on ZK Identity systems: the holder-issuer-verifier model with privacy-preserving credential verification (including UniRep)
- **Emphasized Proof of Exploitability**: using ZK to prove possession of a bug in software without disclosing exploit details, enabling automated triage and private bug markets
- Explored governance applications: voting mechanisms with arbitrary privacy and transparency properties
- Covered ZK applications including Tornado.cash (private deposits/withdrawals), Dark Forest (ZK MMO with decentralized fog of war), and ZKML (verifiable AI model execution)
- Discussed blockchain scaling through ZkEVM: eliminating the need to verify transactions individually for "basically unlimited scaling"
- Positioned Proof of Exploitability as a key security application: running target software in a fuzzing harness within a zkVM to generate crash data/proof without revealing the malicious input
