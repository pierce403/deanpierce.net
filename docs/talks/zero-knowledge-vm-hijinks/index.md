# Zero Knowledge VM Hijinks

A series of talks delivered across 2023 bringing awareness of Zero Knowledge technologies to different communities, each tailored to the audience's interests and concerns.

## The Series

This research thread explores Zero Knowledge Execution Environmentsâ€”computing systems where provers can execute arbitrary programs and prove correct execution to verifiers without revealing private inputs or outputs.

### Audience-Specific Focus

- **ETH Portland (August 2023)**: Focused on the asymmetric unlock of compute power for blockchain scaling, positioning ZK technology as the path to Ethereum's original vision of a "World Computer"

- **BSides Portland (October 2023)**: Emphasized security and privacy applications for the infosec community, particularly Zero Knowledge Proof of Exploitability for automated bug triage and private bug markets

- **Hushcon Seattle (December 2023)**: Explored automated bug markets, self-healing software supply chains, and addressed security community concerns about ZK ransomware scenarios

## Core Themes

Across all presentations, the talks explore:
- The evolution from Zero Knowledge Proofs through Gadgets and Circuits to full Virtual Machines
- Privacy-preserving identity systems and governance mechanisms
- Blockchain scaling through ZK rollups and ZkEVM
- Proof of Exploitability: proving software vulnerabilities without disclosing exploit details
- Economic models for decentralized security research and vulnerability markets
- The inevitability and implications of ZK technology for both offensive and defensive security
