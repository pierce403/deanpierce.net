# Seeds of Contempt

A Java-based exploit framework built on Eclipse RCP (Rich Client Platform), utilizing Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for command and control communications and multi-stage loading of extensions.

## Overview

This project explored building sophisticated exploitation tooling using enterprise Java technologies, demonstrating that legitimate development frameworks could be repurposed for offensive security research. The Eclipse RCP foundation provided a robust plugin architecture, while Java RMI enabled distributed command and control capabilities.

_Note: Additional resources and documentation for this project may be added in the future._
