# Scan Token

A blockchain-based token economy designed to incentivize participation in the NWeb decentralized scanning network.

## Overview

Scan Token provided economic incentives for users to contribute computational resources to the NWeb scanning infrastructure. Participants earned tokens by running Masspull nodes and contributing to the distributed scanning effort.

## Token Economics

- Reward contributors for scanning work
- Enable market-based pricing for scanning services
- Coordinate distributed computing resources
- Demonstrate blockchain-based coordination for security research

This project explored how cryptocurrency incentives could solve the coordination problems inherent in large-scale distributed systems.

_Part of the NWeb project ecosystem_
