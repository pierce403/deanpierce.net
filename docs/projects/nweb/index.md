# NWeb

A decentralized system for scanning and cataloging the Internet, distributing the massive computational task across a network of participants.

## Overview

NWeb explored distributed approaches to Internet-scale scanning, enabling researchers and security professionals to gather data about the global Internet infrastructure without relying on centralized scanning services.

## Components

- **Masspull**: Mass-scanning infrastructure to accelerate NWeb performance
- **Scan Token**: Token-based incentive system to reward participants for contributing scanning resources

The project demonstrated how blockchain-based incentives could coordinate large-scale distributed computing tasks for security research.

_Status: Research project_
