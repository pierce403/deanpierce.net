# ddrp.io

An HTTP-based dead drop system for anonymous, asynchronous communication and data exchange.

## Concept

DDRP (Dead Drop) provided a simple HTTP API for leaving and retrieving messages without requiring direct communication between parties. The system enabled anonymous information exchange similar to physical dead drops used in espionage, but implemented as a web service.

## Use Cases

- Anonymous tip submission
- Asynchronous secure communication
- Privacy-preserving data exchange
- Whistleblower coordination
