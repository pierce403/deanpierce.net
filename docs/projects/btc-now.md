# BTC Now

This was a site that I ran for a few years focused on selling Bitcoin to people as quickly as possible. It was active in the 2011-2014 era. The primary goal here was to get Bitcoin into people's hands as quickly as possible, so I hooked up the Google Checkout API to Bitcoin transactions and changed a premium that would allow me to eat the cost of rampant fraud. For much of this time I was selling about 100 bitcoin per day, and I had enforced a 10 bitcoin per day limit per user, many of whom would buy every day for months at a time.

Should I link to the address here?
