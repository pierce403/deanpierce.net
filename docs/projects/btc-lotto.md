# BTC Lotto

An early Bitcoin lottery system from the 2011 era, exploring provably fair gambling mechanisms on the blockchain before such systems became commonplace.

## Overview

BTC Lotto was one of the early experiments in cryptocurrency-based gaming, demonstrating how blockchain transparency could be leveraged for verifiable lottery systems. As a custodial service from Bitcoin's early days, it helped establish patterns for trustless gaming that would later evolve into fully decentralized protocols.
