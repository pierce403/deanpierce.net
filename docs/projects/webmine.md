# Webmine

Years active : 2017ish

Basically I glued an Ethereum faucet to CoinHive, which was mining Monero in users browser. I would then pay out at a reasonable rate. This never really got big enough to automate backend stuff, and by the time I got it working, AV and even ISPs were treating CoinHive as public enemy #1, which was no fun.
