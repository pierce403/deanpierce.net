# cors.io

I was making a lot of static HTML sites, which means no backend, and an annoying number of APIs had CORS restrictions to try to prevent people from hitting their APIs directly from a browser, so I set up a CORS proxy. As it turned out, it got massively popular and I ended up getting banned from any platform where I would deploy it due to heavy use, and occational use for hosting things like phishing sites (though that was later a solved problem).
