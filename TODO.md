# Website Cleanup TODO

## In Progress

- [ ] Find specific dates for uncertain entries (Hashbounty, They Put Money on the Internet)
- [ ] Expand talks with slides but minimal descriptions (Breaking Same-Origin, Hashbounty, Pickupline, DIY Black Badge)

## Talks - Date Confirmation Needed

- [ ] **Hashbounty**: "Toorcon ~2013ish??" - needs date confirmation
- [ ] **They Put Money on the Internet**: "BSides Portland 2018ish? (TODO)" - needs date confirmation

## Talks - Needs Expansion (Has Slides/Video)

- [ ] **Breaking Same-Origin** (Tizen Conference 2012) - Has slides, needs expansion from slides
- [ ] **Hashbounty** (Toorcon ~2013) - Needs description, confirm date, find resources
- [ ] **Pickupline** (DEF CON 13, 2005) - First DEF CON talk, needs resources/description
- [ ] **DIY Black Badge** (DEFCON 24, 2016) - Has video, needs more context

## Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

- [ ] Find Rolodex video (mentioned in talk page)
- [ ] Consider adding Featured Work section to landing page
- [ ] Implement consistent date formatting across all talks
- [ ] Add tags/categories for organizing talks by theme
- [ ] Consider adding a timeline view of talks/projects
- [ ] Add screenshots/demos to projects where appropriate
